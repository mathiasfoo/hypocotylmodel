# hypocotylmodel
1.	There are three MATLAB files in this folder. The MATLAB function propose_RBLight_ODEmod_com_full.m describes the model equations and parameters values.

2.	For the PRC plotting, open the PRC_plotting.m and propose_RBLight_ODEmod_com_full.m function script. Define the background light intensity in lines 19-20, 52-53, 68-69, and the light stimulus intensity in lines 60-61 of PRC_plotting.m according to the tests described in Table 3 of the manuscript. 

3.	For the simulation of hypocotyl length, open hypocotyl_length.m and propose_RBLight_ODEmod_com_full.m and run the code.
